this is a framework made to help developers make board games 
this is an enhanced version of the old framework named "Board_game_classes.h" (which was provided to me in an assignment in OOP college course CS213 FCAI-CU)
all of the changes I made are described and justified in the comments of the code 
the framework is designed to suit certain specifications:
1. it's made for 2 players only for now
2. there is not properties for the players except : name, symbol and move style
3. the framework is more suitable for XO games more than chess for example
4. general limitations make complicated games require more modifications to the framework

please note that I have done this framework under a lot of pressure and shortage of time due to study pressure , so If it has flaws please send me on this email : alshaer@tuta.io
I have made an example use of the framework, a simple 3x3 Tic Tac Toe
I haven't expansionly tested it, but it seems fine. 

please note this video if you want a justification for the move_style class existance : https://youtu.be/OMPfEXIlTVE?si=wyR7Gk2tAioANzLO


I learned a lot from it and I hope it will be helpful to someone one day !
